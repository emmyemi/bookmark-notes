**Bookmark Notes** is a WebExtension that brings back (to some degree) the pre-v62 ability to add descriptions, sometimes called annotations, to bookmark entries. Notes are synced across Firefox browsers and can be imported from a `bookmarks.html` file from any current version of Firefox.

This extension was built in a day.
